# fizzbuzzapi
This is a simple express server for a fizz buzz api. It was made for an interview. For the next few days you will be able to make calls to it using the following format:

```
curl -X GET 18.224.54.16:3000?n=5
```

set n to any number, and it will return the fizz buzz result for that number. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz
